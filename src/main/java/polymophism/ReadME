Polymorphism :

One Task can be perfrom by differt way i.e convance the custormer

There are Two type of Polymorphism
1. Static PolyMorphism :

Any entity which shows polymorphism during compile time is called static polymorphism.
Operator Overloading, Constructor Overloading and method overloading are best examples of static polymorphism.

In static polymorphism, object used is determined during compilation itself. So, it is called static binding or Early Binding.

2. Dyanamic PolyMorphism ; Any entity which shows polymorphism during run time is called dynamic polymorphism.
 Method Overriding is the best example of dynamic polymorphism.
 It is also called dynamic binding or late binding, because type of the object used will be determined at run time only.
